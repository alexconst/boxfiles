VirtualBox guest tools make file syncing easy.
However official Debian images don't include them since they're on the contrib repos.
So to get things running smoothly some manual intervention is required:
1. comment any `config.vm.provision "shell", path: "provision/` lines that are not relevant to your interests. In most cases this would boil down to either including or not including `.../02_x11.sh`
1. comment the `config.vm.synced_folder` line blocks (there are two!) in the Vagrantfile
1. run `vagrant up`
1. uncomment the `config.vm.synced_folder` line blocks
1. eventually uncomment or add any `config.vm.network` lines of interest
1. run `vagrant reload` (equivalent to `vagrant halt ; vagrant up`

To avoid having to do this (and waiting 10+ minutes) every time, then package the box:
`vagrant package --output Debian_w_VirtualBox_guest_tools.box`
